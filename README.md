# rcellminerData

The NCI-60 cancer cell line panel has been used over the course of several decades as an anti-cancer drug screen. This panel was developed as part of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/) of the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). Thousands of compounds have been tested on the NCI-60, which have been extensively characterized by many platforms for gene and protein expression, copy number, mutation, and others (Reinhold, et al., 2012). The purpose of the CellMiner project (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer) has been to integrate data from multiple platforms used to analyze the NCI-60 and to provide a powerful suite of tools for exploration of NCI-60 data.

# Generating rcellminer Compatible Data Packages
A description of the structure of the data packages is available in the documentation for rcellminerData (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/rcellminerData.html). A small subset dataset is provided at: https://github.com/cannin/rcellminerDemoData that is instructional for developers to understand how to create their own dataset packages.
